    New York City Democratic Socialists is the NYC local of Democratic Socialists of America,
    the largest socialist organization in the United States with about 30,000 members (as of November 2017).
    NYC-DSA is run by its 3,000+ members and activists who are working together to build a democratic socialist
    organization in the five boroughs. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on
    popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism,
    racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.

    We are socialists because we are opposed to an
    economy organized for private profit that produces gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination
    based on race and sex, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because
    we want to work together to develop a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for achieving a transition
    to democratic socialism in America.

    We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of
    American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between
    those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.
    And we believe that only democratic movements and socialist parties can lead the way to a better world.
