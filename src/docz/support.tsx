export const lorem = `New York City Democratic Socialists is the NYC local
of Democratic Socialists of America, the largest socialist organization
in the United States with about 30,000 members (as of November 2017).
NYC-DSA is run by its 3,000+ members and activists who are working together
to build a democratic socialist organization in the five boroughs. We are
socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on
popular control of resources and production, economic planning,
equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality, and non-oppressive
relationships. We are socialists because we are opposed to an economy
organized for private profit that produces gross inequalities of wealth
and power, discrimination based on race and sex, and brutality and
violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we want
to work together to develop a concrete strategy for achieving that
vision, for achieving a transition to democratic socialism in America.
We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of
American society and that this class structure means that there is a
basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic
power and the vast majority of the population. And we believe that only
democratic movements and socialist parties can lead the way to a better
world.`
