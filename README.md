_Typed react component library feat. rebass styled-system styled-components_

`roses` is a simple, extendable design system. It builds on the following libraries, so it's best to be familiar with them as well:

- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for css-in-js
- [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) for handy prop-based styles that cover most use cases
- [rebass](https://rebassjs.org/) brings a layer of additional convention to styled-system

## Setup in your project

Add the package:
`yarn add roses`
You may additionally need to install the following peer dependencies:

```
  yarn add react@^16.7.0
  yarn add react-dom@16.7.0
  yarn add rebass@3.1.0
  yarn add styled-components@4.1.3
  yarn add styled-system@4.0.5"
```

## Usage

Because `roses` hooks into styled components you'll need use a `ThemeProvider` to give them access to this theme. Luckily we have one ready for you which you can extend if needed.

While the `styled-components` theme provider is very permissive in what it will accept as a theme, rebass and styled-system rely on a [specific set of properties](https://styled-system.com/theme-specification)- override these for more control over colors, spacing and more.

```jsx
import { RosesTheme, defaultTheme } from "roses"
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components"

// Adding a helpful tool to our theme.
const customTheme = {
  ...defaultTheme,
  utils: {
    breakApp: () => {
      throw new Error("oops!")
    },
  },
}

const DefaultThemedApp = ({ children }) => <RosesTheme>{children}</RosesTheme>

const CustomThemedApp = ({ children }) => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
    <>
      <MyGlobalStyles />
      {
        /* ThemeProvider Children must be a node, so <> Fragment </> is required */
        children
      }
    </>
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```
